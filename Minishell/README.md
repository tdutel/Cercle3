## üìë Introduction
Minishell is a project that aims to create a basic shell with some of the functionalities of a real shell.<br>
It allows users to enter and execute commands, as well as perform some simple shell operations.

## üñ•Ô∏è Description
The minishell project involves creating a program that functions as a shell. <br>
The program should read in user input, parse the input to separate commands and arguments, and then execute the requested command using fork and execve. <br>
The program should also handle environment variables, signal handling, and built-in commands such as cd, echo, and exit.

## üíΩ Usage
To compile the program, run the following command:
```shell
make
```
It will compile the program and create an executable called "minishell".<br>

To disable the program's easteregg, run the following command:
```shell
make CFLAGS+="-D EASTER_EGG=0"
```

To run the program, simply execute the created executable:
```shell
./minishell
```
The program will then display a prompt, where the user can enter commands.
